# Suspicious Login Detection: Email Template
This repository includes two files: `html-template.html` and `plain-text-template.txt`. These two files contain a starting point for you to send out your own suspicious email notification emails/alerts. They work across all email clients, and have been tested through [Zenlogin](https://zenlogin.co/?gh) itself.

These are free to use (MIT licensed). We just ask (naturally) that you don't use the deep-linked assets (the icons). The reason is, we may change the host / URL in the future, and this would break your emails.

If you're looking for a hosted solution to this, Zenlogin offers an API which is used by small and larger security-focused companies. For projects and small companies, you can get started with our Free plan as well.

## About Zenlogin
**[Zenlogin](https://zenlogin.co/)** is a security API that helps you secure your login and signup flows. After signing up, you'll be given an API endpoint and secret key. By integrating these into your authentication flow, Zenlogin will then detect any suspicious login attempts and email the user (from an email address you choose) to inform them of the login.
